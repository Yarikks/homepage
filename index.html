                    <li>In January 2019, Musk traveled to China for the groundbreaking of Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory,
                      which is the company's first large-scale plant outside the U.S. Part of his visit to China, Musk
                      also met the Chinese premier Li Keqiang. During their exchange, Musk confessed his love for China
                      and wished he could visit China more often, to which the Chinese premier was quoted as saying "We
                      can issue you a Chinese green card if that helps."</li>

                            Musk first mentioned Teslaquila in an April Fools tweet in 2018. The proposed Tesla-branded
                            tequila become closer to a reality in October 2018 as Tesla filed an 'intent to use'
                            trademark application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The trademark is for
                            distilled agave liquor. Musk reaffirmed his intention to release the product with a tweet,
                            featuring a mockup of the bottle, on October 12.

                            In October 2018, in an effort to help solve the Flint water crisis, Musk and the Musk
                            Foundation donated over $480,000 to install new water fountains with filtration systems for
                            access to clean water at all Flint, Michigan schools.

                            In mid-September 2018, Musk appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast and discussed
                            various topics for 21/2 hours. Within five days, the appearance had registered 10 million
                            YouTube views. One of the highest profile and controversial aspects of the program was
                            Musk's puffing from a cannabis-laced cigarette offered by Rogan. The Washington Post
                            observed, "In the media's hands, it became a story about Musk's growing instability ..."
                            Tesla stock dropped after the incident, which coincided with the confirmation of the
                            departure of Tesla's Vice President of Worldwide Finance earlier that day. Fortune wondered
                            if the cannabis use could have ramifications for SpaceX contracts with the United States Air
                            Force, though a USAF spokesperson told The Verge that there was no investigation being
                            carried out and that the Air Force is still processing the situation.

                            In an interview with Joe Rogan in September 2018, Musk warned about the dangers of
                            developing artificial intelligence indiscriminately.

                            In September 2018, Musk was charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a
                            tweet claiming that funding had been secured for taking Tesla private. The lawsuit
                            characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors. As a result, Musk
                            and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was forced to step down as Tesla chairman
                            within 45 days while remaining Tesla's CEO. Musk also proclaimed in several interviews since
                            that he does not regret sending the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation. According to
                            Reuters, Musk said the tweet that cost him and the company $20 million in fines was "Worth
                            It".

                            In July 2018, Musk attempted to provide assistance to rescuers during the Tham Luang cave
                            rescue by ordering his employees to build a small rescue pod. Thai authorities decided not
                            to use the submarine, describing it as technologically impressive but impractical

                            On May 7, 2018, Musk and Canadian musician Grimes revealed that they had begun dating.

                            In 2018 Musk left the OpenAI board to avoid possible future conflicts with his role as CEO
                            of Tesla as Tesla increasingly becomes involved in AI.
